//when you write react code you write individual snippetes or code
//or componenets
//Write javascript that will produce html
//Transpile from es6 to something else to html

//Weback and babel transpile es6 to html
//JSX + ES6 -> ES5
//--> spits out application.js file

//Create new component. This component should produce some HTML.
const App = function() {
	return <div>Hi!</div>; //this is jsx (subset of js)
} //This stuff gets rendered


//Make sure that this component gets put into the DOM
//Take the generated HTML and put it on the page
